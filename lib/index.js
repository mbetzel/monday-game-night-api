Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2010},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":7},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":1310,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":693}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":99},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":281},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":529}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":289},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":659},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":108}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":665},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":441},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":27}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":529},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":537},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":36}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":240},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":678},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":99}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":221},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":617},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":172}]},{"numplayers":"7+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":15},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":54},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":462}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":293,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":1},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":8},{"value":8,"numvotes":75},{"value":10,"numvotes":109},{"value":12,"numvotes":79},{"value":14,"numvotes":17},{"value":16,"numvotes":3},{"value":18,"numvotes":1},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":359,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":273},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":81},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":4},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":1},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":30},"minplaytime":{"value":30},"maxplaytime":{"value":30},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1050,"value":"Ancient"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1029,"value":"City Building"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1015,"value":"Civilization"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2020,"value":"Simultaneous Action Selection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":17552,"value":"7 Wonders"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":27646,"value":"Tableau Building"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":154638,"value":"7 Wonders: Babel"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":110308,"value":"7 Wonders: Catan"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":111661,"value":"7 Wonders: Cities"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":92539,"value":"7 Wonders: Leaders"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":83445,"value":"7 Wonders: Manneken Pis"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":133993,"value":"7 Wonders: Wonder Pack"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":164649,"value":"Collection (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":140098,"value":"Empires (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":138187,"value":"Game Wonders (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":134849,"value":"Lost Wonders (fan expansion for 7 Wonders)"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":131947,"value":"More Wonders...

The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&#10;&#10;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&#10;&#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses.

You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&#10;&#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":48,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":27}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":11},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":30},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":26},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":13},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":8},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":28},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":23}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":14,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":4},{"value":10,"numvotes":6},{"value":12,"numvotes":2},{"value":14,"numvotes":1},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":25,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":1},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":2},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":14},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":8}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":120},"minplaytime":{"value":90},"maxplaytime":{"value":120},"minage":{"value":13},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1029,"value":"City Building"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1020,"value":"Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1010,"value":"Fantasy"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2001,"value":"Action Point Allowance System"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2664,"value":"Deck / Pool Building"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2027,"value":"Storytelling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2008,"value":"Trading"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":8374,"value":"Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":175452,"value":"Above and Below: Expanded Edition exclusives"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":211171,"value":"Above and Below: G@mebox Building promo card"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":213992,"value":"Above and Below: Groves"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":208201,"value":"Above and Below: Watch It Played Building promo card"},{"type":"boardgameintegration","id":185589,"value":"Islebound"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":11854,"value":"Ryan Laukat"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11854,"value":"Ryan Laukat"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":18617,"value":"Red Raven Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":917,"value":"dV Giochi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":24844,"value":"Schwerkraft-Verlag"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":155987,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1965255_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1965255.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Abyss"},"description":"The Abyss power is once again vacant, so the time has come to get your hands on the throne and its privileges.

At that point, the game will temporarily stop so that players may earn gold and take several kingdom&ndash;building actions in preparation for the next age.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2009},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":66,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":33}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":26},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":19}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":5},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":37},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":57},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":6},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":23}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":20,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":3},{"value":12,"numvotes":13},{"value":14,"numvotes":4},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":32,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":9},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":23},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":90},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1010,"value":"Fantasy"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1093,"value":"Novel-based"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1019,"value":"Wargame"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2079,"value":"Variable Phase Order"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":166729,"value":"Age of Conan: The Strategy Board Game – Adventures in Hyboria"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":3247,"value":"Roberto Di Meglio"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":934,"value":"Marco Maggi"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":935,"value":"Francesco Nepitello"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":20674,"value":"Matteo Macchi"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":20670,"value":"Fabio Maiorana"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":14355,"value":"J.

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2007},"minplayers":{"value":1},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":1546,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":58},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":665},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":301}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":283},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":843},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":134}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":767},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":536},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":23}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":901},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":424},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":21}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":285},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":671},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":206}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":8},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":554}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":487,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":2},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":2},{"value":6,"numvotes":8},{"value":8,"numvotes":48},{"value":10,"numvotes":119},{"value":12,"numvotes":176},{"value":14,"numvotes":103},{"value":16,"numvotes":23},{"value":18,"numvotes":4},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":2}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":663,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":1},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with \"ice\". These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2012},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":2},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race.

Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.&#10;&#10;There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within \"range\" of your current gun.  The target player can play a \"MISSED!\" card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!&#10;&#10;Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2002},"minplayers":{"value":4},"maxplayers":{"value":7},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":353,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":217}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":223}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":228}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":7},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":93},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":165}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":91},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":195},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":20}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":103},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":198},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":221},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":88},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":18}]},{"numplayers":"7+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":28},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":69},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":97}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":90,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":2},{"value":8,"numvotes":34},{"value":10,"numvotes":38},{"value":12,"numvotes":12},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":4},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":115,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":10},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":81},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":24},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":40},"minplaytime":{"value":20},"maxplaytime":{"value":40},"minage":{"value":8},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1055,"value":"American West"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1023,"value":"Bluffing"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1039,"value":"Deduction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2019,"value":"Partnerships"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2685,"value":"Player Elimination"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2686,"value":"Take That"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":3862,"value":"BANG!"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":20237,"value":"BANG!

Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?&#10;&#10;BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table.

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&#10;&#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?&#10;&#10;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&#10;&#10;Official Site, Rules & FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&esem=4&#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2008},"minplayers":{"value":3},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":819,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":12},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":467}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":474}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":14},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":141},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":422}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":49},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":456},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":155}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":626},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":140},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":257},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":390},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":56}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":26},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":91},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":245}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":215,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":6},{"value":12,"numvotes":66},{"value":14,"numvotes":89},{"value":16,"numvotes":43},{"value":18,"numvotes":7},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":2}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":267,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.

During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the \"auction variation\" of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The \"auction variations\" are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1987},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":8},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":34,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":21}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":20},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":7},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":21},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":27},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":9},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":21},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":7},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":17},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":12}]},{"numplayers":8,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":18}]},{"numplayers":"8+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":21}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":13,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":1},{"value":6,"numvotes":10},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":0},{"value":12,"numvotes":0},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":18,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":18},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":45},"minplaytime":{"value":15},"maxplaytime":{"value":45},"minage":{"value":7},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1032,"value":"Action / Dexterity"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2012,"value":"Auction/Bidding"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5607,"value":"3D Games"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":43236,"value":"Bausack: Extension Kit"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":267,"value":"Klaus Zoch"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":73417,"value":"Olivia Schuff"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4335,"value":"Competo / Marektoy"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5530,"value":"Giochi Uniti"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2832,"value":"Lord Carter"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":20,"value":"Milton Bradley"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":14078,"value":"Vennerød Forlag AS"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":87,"value":"Zoch Verlag"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":10547,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828598_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828598.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Betrayal at House on the Hill"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"山中小屋的背叛者"}],"description":"From the press release:&#10;&#10;Betrayal at House on the Hill quickly builds suspense and excitement as players explore a haunted mansion of their own design, encountering spirits and frightening omens that foretell their fate.

The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.&#10;&#10;There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Blokus Game Board (400 squares)&#10;84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)&#10;Each color inlcudes:&#10;&#10;     1 one-square piece&#10;     1 piece with 2 squares&#10;     2 pieces with 3 squares&#10;     5 pieces with 4 squares&#10;     12 pieces with 5 squares&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;1.  Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&#10;&#10;2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&#10;&#10;3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&#10;&#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&#10;&#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&#10;&#10;4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.

Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":195,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":104}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":4},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":52},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":80}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":21},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":112},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":16}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":147},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":23},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":25},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":33},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":36}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":37,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":4},{"value":10,"numvotes":11},{"value":12,"numvotes":16},{"value":14,"numvotes":5},{"value":16,"numvotes":1},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":28,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":1},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":23},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":3},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":1}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":13},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1010,"value":"Fantasy"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1047,"value":"Miniatures"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1082,"value":"Mythology"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2001,"value":"Action Point Allowance System"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":25158,"value":"Components: Miniatures"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":8374,"value":"Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5613,"value":"Vikings"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174506,"value":"Blood Rage: 5th Player Expansion"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174801,"value":"Blood Rage: Gods of Ásgard"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":193898,"value":"Blood Rage: Hili – The Even-Handed"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174388,"value":"Blood Rage: Kickstarter Exclusives"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":175100,"value":"Blood Rage: Mystics of Midgard"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":23985,"value":"Midgard","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":1533,"value":"Eric M.

to score points from the map they're creating. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Instead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.&#10;&#10;It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:&#10;- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place a tile.&#10;- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.&#10;- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.&#10;- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.&#10;&#10;The Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2002},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":131,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":77}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":73},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":48},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":65},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":47},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":28},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":60},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":15}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":10},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":52},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":37}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":59}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":41,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":2},{"value":6,"numvotes":11},{"value":8,"numvotes":22},{"value":10,"numvotes":6},{"value":12,"numvotes":0},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":51,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":51},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":45},"minplaytime":{"value":30},"maxplaytime":{"value":45},"minage":{"value":8},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1036,"value":"Prehistoric"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2002,"value":"Tile Placement"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":2,"value":"Carcassonne"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":7707,"value":"Carcassonne: King & Scout"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":24506,"value":"Carcassonne: Kreivi ja Kuningas"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":92332,"value":"Carcassonne: The Phantom"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":21165,"value":"Die Steinmauer (Fan Expansion for Carcassonne: Die Jäger und Sammler)"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":822,"value":"Carcassonne","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":398,"value":"Klaus-Jürgen Wrede"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":233,"value":"Johann Rüttinger"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":133,"value":"Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2366,"value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":18852,"value":"Hobby World"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3218,"value":"Lautapelit.fi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3395,"value":"Midgaard Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7992,"value":"MINDOK"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8313,"value":"Smart Ltd"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":538,"value":"Z-Man Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":43443,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic496923_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic496923.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Castle Panic"},"description":"The forest is filled with all sorts of monsters.

One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.&#10;&#10;After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;The Settlers of Catan is the original game in the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1995},"minplayers":{"value":3},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1996},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":2},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

Whoever controls this \"cosmic egg\" can shape the birthing of the next universe according to their own agenda. Players are secret agents from a handful of surviving worlds, zipping from planet to planet in special &ldquo;amnion suits&rdquo; that allow for interstellar travel, space combat and planetary landings.&#10;&#10;Each planet has its own envelope of cards. When you arrive on a planet, you decide which cards you want to take and which to leave behind. Knowledge is the most powerful resource in the game, and being able to predict the cards your opponents possess at any given time is a powerful advantage as you build up a handful of weapons, tactical gear, vaults and traps, as well as cards that counter your opponents' cards. The best players will keep their hand fluid, constantly changing tactics while they search from world to world for the Ovoid or find a safe place to stash it.&#10;&#10;Balance your hand of cards, spend your turn actions wisely, and cleverly use your special alien powers to stay one step ahead of your opponents. When the Chaos Clock reaches zero, only the player who possesses the Ovoid will become master of the new universe.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":15,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":11},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":3,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":2},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":4,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels:  The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.\"&#10;&#10;\"The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors.

Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant. Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth. However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. &#10; As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.&#10;&#10;The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1995},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

Only one family will survive...&#10;&#10;In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury.

Block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.&#10;     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.&#10;     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&#10;&#10;A new & optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards & Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck.

This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2014},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":342,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":183}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":70},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":147}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":41},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":205},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":13}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":221},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":84},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":98},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":132},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":33}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":5},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":16},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":128}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":95,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":16},{"value":12,"numvotes":34},{"value":14,"numvotes":35},{"value":16,"numvotes":8},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":112,"results":{"result":[{"level":6,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":7,"value":"Some necessary text -

For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways.

The rest get to be lunch.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players must choose one of two options: (1) place a tile from their hand onto the board, expanding the dungeon; or (2) move their Hero to an adjacent tile.

Differences between characters are significant, with many having poor fighting skills.

Points are collected by moving adventurers out of the dungeon or by killing an opponent's adventurer. Objects are disseminated across the whole dungeon and will bring the adventurers well-needed powers.&#10;&#10;Each player has the same characters, each with different powers. Some run fast, some fight or disarm traps. The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight, and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points.&#10;&#10;Combat and actions are managed via cards. To move, fight, heal, or turn a room, you must manage action points obtained by playing cards. Those cards are not drawn but selected from a set of cards by both players. Both players have access to the same panel of cards at the beginning of the game, so the game is really about managing the resources and adapting to the changing environment.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Twister

Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting resources from the board and the cards). Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!&#10;&#10;In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed.  The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately.  Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.&#10;&#10;Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.

To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1995},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":420,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":229}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":43},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":260}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":18},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":156},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":144}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":132},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":227},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":309},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":72},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":157}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":70,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":6},{"value":10,"numvotes":21},{"value":12,"numvotes":30},{"value":14,"numvotes":11},{"value":16,"numvotes":1},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":1}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":109,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":3},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":20},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":74},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":12},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":120},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":120},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1070,"value":"Renaissance"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2012,"value":"Auction/Bidding"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2047,"value":"Memory"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2020,"value":"Simultaneous Action Selection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10310,"value":"Country: Spain"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":9959,"value":"El Grande"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":583,"value":"The El Grande Expansions"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":597,"value":"El Grande: Grandissimo"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":3146,"value":"El Grande: Grossinquisitor und Kolonien"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":370,"value":"El Grande: König & Intrigant"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":5754,"value":"El Grande: König & Intrigant – Player's Edition"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":27759,"value":"El Grande: König & Intrigant – Unverkäufliche Sonderkarten"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":171908,"value":"El Grande Big Box"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":147170,"value":"El Grande Decennial Edition"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":7,"value":"Wolfgang Kramer"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":8,"value":"Richard Ulrich"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":74,"value":"Doris Matthäus"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":133,"value":"Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":403,"value":"Användbart Litet Företag"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":41,"value":"Descartes Editeur"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5657,"value":"Filosofia Éditions"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8500,"value":"Gabinete Lúdico"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":68425,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1160506_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1160506.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Eminent Domain"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Eminent Domain: Космическая эра"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"エミネント・ドメイン"}],"description":"Survey the galaxy to expand your civilization &ndash; will you colonize nearby planets, or take them over by force?

All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&#10;    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&#10;    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&#10;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&#10;&#10;&#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you \"discover\" magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&#10;&#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the \"Treasures\" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the \"Curses\" module, some tiles \"curse\" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2012},"minplayers":{"value":1},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":116,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":5},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":50},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":27}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":12},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":77},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":34},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":62},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":62},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":37},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":37},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":53},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":16},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":30}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":40,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":7},{"value":8,"numvotes":25},{"value":10,"numvotes":6},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":1},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":49,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":49},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a \"stop\" rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a \"Dashboard\" with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with \"Character\" profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of \"Fuel\" for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of \"after market\" parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2008},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":10},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":156,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":17},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":94}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":44},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":72}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":11},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":68},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":40}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":32},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":88},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":14}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":78},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":50},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":87},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":41},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":72},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":45},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":8,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":72},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":45},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]},{"numplayers":9,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":33},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":57},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":23}]},{"numplayers":10,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":40},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":58},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":25}]},{"numplayers":"10+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":4},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":16},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":53}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":57,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":1},{"value":6,"numvotes":11},{"value":8,"numvotes":33},{"value":10,"numvotes":8},{"value":12,"numvotes":3},{"value":14,"numvotes":1},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":65,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":61},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special \"Star Wars\" laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1986},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":42,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":22}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":23},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":13},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":25},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":26},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":24}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":12,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":7},{"value":14,"numvotes":1},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":13,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":8},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":4},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":1},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":180},"minplaytime":{"value":180},"maxplaytime":{"value":180},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1019,"value":"Wargame"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":26464,"value":"Alternate History"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":14835,"value":"Country: USA"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":89,"value":"Gamemaster Series"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":32619,"value":"5th Column (fan expansion for Fortress America)"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":13119,"value":"Fortress America: Expansion Pack #1"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":27727,"value":"Fortress Illinois"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":115293,"value":"Fortress America"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":20,"value":"Milton Bradley"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":115293,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180433_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1180433.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Fortress America"},"description":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In Fortress America, the United States must defend itself from three deadly invading armies: the Asian People's Alliance from the West, the Central American Federation from the South, and the Euro-Socialist Pact from the East. Players take on either the role of the United States, struggling to protect itself from foreign threat, or the role of one or more of the invading armies, fighting battle after battle to acquire important territories.&#10;&#10;If the invading forces claim enough U.S. cities, America's defense is broken and the nation falls. But if the United States can protect its cities for long enough, the invading forces fail to uproot America and their incursion is ended.&#10;&#10;Fortress America is played over several rounds in which each player musters his forces, moves into enemy-controlled territories, and engages in fierce firefights. But depending on whether you're the U.S. player or one of the Invaders, your play experience and general strategy will be entirely different. The U.S. must efficiently wield its colossal lasers, the ultimate weapons of mass destruction, in its own defense. What's more, as U.S. hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, and infantry are destroyed and removed from the map, a steady supply of American guerilla fighters spring up to defend their homeland. The U.S. player is surrounded and alone, and must do his best to fend off advances on three fronts in a series of tense battles.&#10;&#10;The Invaders, on the other hand, must remain constantly aggressive. Their objective is to collectively capture 18 of 30 major U.S. cities, and to do so, they must apply early pressure before the U.S. has a chance to react, and keep the pressure constant. To complicate the Invaders' mission, their armies do not receive additional reinforcements, so they must make optimal use of the forces at their disposal. Through a series of nail-biting battles that use a unique dice-based combat system, each player will maneuver his dwindling armies to secure his objective. But can America be stopped, or will a failed invasion only compel them to tighten their military grip on the world.&#10;&#10;Changed in this edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Custom combat dice, debatable if better than normal dice.&#10;     A ten-turn timer gives the U.S. player an additional path to victory: outlasting the invasion.&#10;     A \"Captured City\" track lets all players see, at a quick glance, how close they are to victory or defeat.&#10;     A few city locations have been removed, and others added, to create a different (possibly more balanced) play experience.&#10;     A deck of variant cards for the Invader players has been added to use as a rules option (equal to 1-2 balance levels).&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (1986)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2012},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":16,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":7}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":8},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":3,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":1},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":3,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":2},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":1},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":150},"minplaytime":{"value":150},"maxplaytime":{"value":150},"minage":{"value":0},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1019,"value":"Wargame"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":14835,"value":"Country: USA"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":99,"value":"Fortress America","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":287,"value":"Michael Gray"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17,"value":"Fantasy Flight Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":140603,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1616979_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1616979.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Francis Drake"},"description":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Return to a bustling Plymouth Harbor in 1572 as an aspiring Elizabethan captain making preparations for three exciting voyages to the Spanish Main in search of fame and fortune!

Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2007},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":302,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":148}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":19},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":177},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":54}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":64},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":192},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":246},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":31},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":109}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":63,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":1},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":1},{"value":6,"numvotes":2},{"value":8,"numvotes":16},{"value":10,"numvotes":29},{"value":12,"numvotes":11},{"value":14,"numvotes":3},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":100,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":17},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":76},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":7},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1079,"value":"Humor"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1037,"value":"Real-time"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1113,"value":"Space Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1011,"value":"Transportation"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2002,"value":"Tile Placement"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":97845,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: Another Big Expansion"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":40484,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: Bonus Cards"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":132435,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: Even-Steven Cards"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":144227,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: Latest Models"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":182027,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: Missions"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":33963,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: Rough Road Ahead"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":38378,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: The Big Expansion"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":140068,"value":"Galaxy Trucker: Anniversary Edition"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":789,"value":"Vlaada Chvátil"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":28450,"value":"Tomáš Kučerovský"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11938,"value":"Radim Pech"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7345,"value":"Czech Games Edition"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4304,"value":"Albi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":264,"value":"Heidelberger Spieleverlag"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6275,"value":"HomoLudicus"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8923,"value":"IELLO"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":25203,"value":"Lex Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":23031,"value":"Magellan"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":30552,"value":"One Moment Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8795,"value":"Playgo Hungary"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4696,"value":"Quined White Goblin Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7466,"value":"REBEL.pl"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6123,"value":"Red Glove"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":21053,"value":"REXhry"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":42776,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1004112_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1004112.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Gears of War: The Board Game"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Gears of War: Das Brettspiel"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Gears of War: El Juego de Tablero"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Gears of War: Gra Planszowa"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Gears of War: Le jeu de plateau"}],"description":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;For a time, the humans of Sera knew peace...then Emergence Day came.

But they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space. Various private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a suitable carbonaceous asteroid. To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant. Also needed are remote-controlled robonauts to do the grunt work.&#10;&#10;The key to success is water in LEO (low Earth orbit). At first, water will be expensively supported out of the deep gravity well of Earth. But for a third the fuel and energy, water can be supplied from Luna, the moons of Mars, or other nearby hydrated objects.  Extracting resources at the work site is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization.&#10;&#10;In High Frontier, players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system.  Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics.  Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts.  Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system.&#10;&#10;Now in its second edition.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2010},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":39,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":23},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":21},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":20},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":11},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":13},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":14}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":19,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":0},{"value":12,"numvotes":5},{"value":14,"numvotes":8},{"value":16,"numvotes":6},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":19,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":13},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":4},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":2},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":180},"minplaytime":{"value":180},"maxplaytime":{"value":180},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1088,"value":"Industry / Manufacturing"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1113,"value":"Space Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2012,"value":"Auction/Bidding"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2007,"value":"Pick-up and Deliver"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2078,"value":"Point to Point Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2070,"value":"Simulation"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":124147,"value":"High Frontier Colonization"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":68305,"value":"High Frontier Expansion"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":149689,"value":"High Frontier Interstellar"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":172737,"value":"High Frontier (3rd edition)"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":174333,"value":"High Frontier Lite"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":5525,"value":"Rocket Flight","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":174,"value":"Phil Eklund"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":174,"value":"Phil Eklund"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":101,"value":"Sierra Madre Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":2655,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791151_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic791151.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Hive"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Bug"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":4,"value":"La colmena"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Rój"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Улей"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"ハイヴ"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"蟲蟲攻防戰"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"蟲蟲蜂房 (虫虫蜂房) Hive (繁簡版)"}],"description":"From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;Hive is a highly addictive strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be played anywhere on any flat surface.

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name \"Hoppla -

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President.

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a \"home\" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers.

Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!&#10;&#10;King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.&#10;&#10;What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve \"Fame\", which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.&#10;&#10;The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.&#10;&#10;The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2014},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":66,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":41}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":44}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":8},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":33},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":41},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":17},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":17},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":36},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":12},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":32},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":7}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":27}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":24,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":1},{"value":6,"numvotes":4},{"value":8,"numvotes":10},{"value":10,"numvotes":8},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":22,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":6},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":15},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":1},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":40},"minplaytime":{"value":40},"maxplaytime":{"value":40},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1017,"value":"Dice"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1064,"value":"Movies / TV / Radio theme"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2685,"value":"Player Elimination"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":13111,"value":"Cities: New York (New York, USA)"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":14835,"value":"Country: USA"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":24569,"value":"Kaiju"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":28525,"value":"King of Tokyo"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5615,"value":"Monsters"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":178739,"value":"King of New York Promo Cards"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":167897,"value":"King of New York: 55 Central Park West"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174149,"value":"King of New York: Force of Unnature"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":173363,"value":"King of New York: Hibernation"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":167896,"value":"King of New York: Improvised Weapons"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":164247,"value":"King of New York: Monster Idol"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174148,"value":"King of New York: Nano Bots"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174147,"value":"King of New York: New York City Defender"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":193320,"value":"King of New York: Power Up!"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":210967,"value":"King of New York: Sewer Crocs"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":173362,"value":"King of New York: St. George Theater"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174151,"value":"King of New York: Trump Tower"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":174150,"value":"King of New York: U.N.

The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero.  The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.&#10;&#10;A Hero deck and a Zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using 6-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards heroes may be equipped with. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie.  All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel. The game also comes with a CD Soundtrack of original thematic music.&#10;&#10;Each hero has its own plastic sculpted miniature.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains \"master strike\" cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all

given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. \"there are ten sixes\". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice.  This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1987},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":138,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":84}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":5},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":18},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":84}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":11},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":64},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":38}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":42},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":75},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":58},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":62},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":84},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":35},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":20},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":33},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":32}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":34,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":4},{"value":8,"numvotes":25},{"value":10,"numvotes":3},{"value":12,"numvotes":2},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":48,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":48},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":30},"minplaytime":{"value":15},"maxplaytime":{"value":30},"minage":{"value":8},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1023,"value":"Bluffing"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1017,"value":"Dice"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1064,"value":"Movies / TV / Radio theme"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1030,"value":"Party Game"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2014,"value":"Betting/Wagering"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2685,"value":"Player Elimination"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5597,"value":"Celebrities: Walt Disney"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":22160,"value":"Dice cup bluffing games"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10441,"value":"Pirates of the Caribbean"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5636,"value":"TV Series: The Simpsons"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":11205,"value":"Wayne's World"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":7159,"value":"The Boardgame Book"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":157432,"value":"Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest: 3 in 1 Pirate Games Collector's Edition"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":8950,"value":"Bid It"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":164051,"value":"Troc•Sushi: Game of Bluff"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":3,"value":"(Uncredited)"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":25,"value":"Richard Borg"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":3,"value":"(Uncredited)"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":45736,"value":"Rita Åse"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":4177,"value":"Bildgården AB"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":44835,"value":"Design Edge"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":78608,"value":"H.P.

However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite.  To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.  As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn.

The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good \"couples\" game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.&#10;&#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1999},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":2},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":220,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":160}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":203},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":15},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":4},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":144}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":77,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":2},{"value":6,"numvotes":9},{"value":8,"numvotes":50},{"value":10,"numvotes":15},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":109,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":109},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":30},"minplaytime":{"value":30},"maxplaytime":{"value":30},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1020,"value":"Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":21940,"value":"Archaeology"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":78,"value":"Kosmos two-player series"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":149,"value":"Lost Cities"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":206374,"value":"Lost Cities: Sixth Expedition"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":2,"value":"Reiner Knizia"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":26874,"value":"Michaela Kienle"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":22516,"value":"Anke Pohl"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":22515,"value":"Thilo Rick"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11902,"value":"Claus Stephan"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11883,"value":"Franz Vohwinkel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4304,"value":"Albi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4335,"value":"Competo / Marektoy"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2366,"value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5657,"value":"Filosofia Éditions"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4617,"value":"Galakta"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6214,"value":"Kaissa Chess & Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8291,"value":"Korea Boardgames co., Ltd."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":37,"value":"KOSMOS"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5597,"value":"Laser plus"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3395,"value":"Midgaard Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":22,"value":"Piatnik"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":19148,"value":"Playhouse Ltd"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9235,"value":"Stupor Mundi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9234,"value":"Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":42,"value":"Tilsit"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1466,"value":"Zvezda"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":42487,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2606157_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2606157.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Lost Cities: The Board Game"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Затерянные города 2"}],"description":"Redevelopment of Lost Cities, first published with altered rules as Keltis, and then published by Rio Grande as Lost Cities: The Board Game with Knizia's original rules and theme.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reiner Knizia:  \"The original version that we developed is exactly what Jay [Tummelson, owner of Rio Grande Games] has now published [LCBG]\"  &#10;&#10;&#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&#10;&#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.&#10;     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Keltis entry:&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).&#10;     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.&#10;     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)&#10;     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.&#10;     All this is added to the points scored during the game&#10;&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2008},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":27,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":3}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":13},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":12},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":8,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":4},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":2},{"value":12,"numvotes":0},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":8,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":8},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":30},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":8},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1022,"value":"Adventure"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1020,"value":"Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":149,"value":"Lost Cities"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":2,"value":"Reiner Knizia"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12834,"value":"Annette Nora Kara"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":37,"value":"KOSMOS"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1466,"value":"Zvezda"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":129622,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1401448_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1401448.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Love Letter"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Letters to Santa"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"List Miłosny"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Love Letter Kanai"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Love Letter: Kanai Factory Limited Edition"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Love Letter: Legend of the Five Rings"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Love Letter: Wedding Edition"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Milostný dopis"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Morgen kommt der Weihnachtsmann: Mein Wunschzettel"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Munchkin Loot Letter"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Тайное послание"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"ラブレター"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"情书"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"情書"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"러브 레터"}],"description":"All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest.

Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards will be available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;The Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook.

More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&#10;&#10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&#10;&#10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Components for up to six players instead of five&#10;    Special two-player variant rules&#10;    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards&#10;    Mars' moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself&#10;&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":42,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":23}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":19}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":4},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":26},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":21},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":13},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":15},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":13}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":14,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":5},{"value":12,"numvotes":6},{"value":14,"numvotes":1},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":7,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":6},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":1},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":45},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":14},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2020,"value":"Simultaneous Action Selection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10169,"value":"Mars"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5610,"value":"Steampunk"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":18258,"value":"Mission: Red Planet","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":1727,"value":"Bruno Cathala"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":125,"value":"Bruno Faidutti"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":40597,"value":"Andrew Bosley"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":78938,"value":"Samuel Shimota"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2973,"value":"Edge Entertainment"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17,"value":"Fantasy Flight Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4617,"value":"Galakta"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5530,"value":"Giochi Uniti"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":264,"value":"Heidelberger Spieleverlag"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":21763,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3066125_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3066125.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Mr. Jack"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":5,"value":"Une Ombre sur Whitechapel"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Shadows over Whitechapel"}],"description":"In Mr. Jack, one of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the eight characters on the board.

The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).&#10;&#10;The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire  buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2010},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":138,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":51}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":11},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":58},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":31}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":24},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":63},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":16}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":87},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":21},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":26},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":64},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":41}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":24,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":3},{"value":12,"numvotes":17},{"value":14,"numvotes":3},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":41,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":27},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":14},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1020,"value":"Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1008,"value":"Nautical"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1070,"value":"Renaissance"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":21622,"value":"Colonial Theme"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5614,"value":"Country: Portugal"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":84,"value":"Rondel Series"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":120105,"value":"Navegador: Pirates & Diplomats"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":209573,"value":"Navegador: Privilege Cards"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":6045,"value":"Mac Gerdts"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":31545,"value":"Marina Fahrenbach"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":6045,"value":"Mac Gerdts"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":10768,"value":"Cranio Creations"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2862,"value":"The Game Master BV"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8401,"value":"PD-Verlag"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2861,"value":"Ystari Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":35435,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1182301_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1182301.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Nefertiti"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Néfertiti"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Nofretete"}],"description":"From the back of the box:&#10;Akhenaton, Pharoah of Upper & Lower Egypt, God among men, all powerful sovereign, he trembles before no-one.

The novices move in secret and avoid being seen or heard by the Abbess or Prioress. The goal is to make it to the location on the board where the novice can get her \"secret wish\" and return to their room without being detected.

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":251,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":7},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":40},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":110}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":33},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":130},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":28}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":46},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":122},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":18}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":145},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":65},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":7}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":116}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":69,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":1},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":6},{"value":10,"numvotes":17},{"value":12,"numvotes":27},{"value":14,"numvotes":14},{"value":16,"numvotes":2},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":1}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":69,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":1},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":8},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":48},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":12}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":13},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1084,"value":"Environmental"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":2145,"value":"Medical"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2001,"value":"Action Point Allowance System"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2023,"value":"Co-operative Play"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2078,"value":"Point to Point Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2008,"value":"Trading"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":24281,"value":"Campaign Games"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":25404,"value":"Legacy"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":3430,"value":"Pandemic"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":30549,"value":"Pandemic","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":442,"value":"Rob Daviau"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":378,"value":"Matt Leacock"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":14057,"value":"Chris Quilliams"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":538,"value":"Z-Man Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":15889,"value":"Asterion Press"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2366,"value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5657,"value":"Filosofia Éditions"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8820,"value":"Gém Klub Kft."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1391,"value":"Hobby Japan"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":15983,"value":"Jolly Thinkers"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5812,"value":"Lacerta"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9325,"value":"Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7992,"value":"MINDOK"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":163412,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2270442_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2270442.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Patchwork"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Пэчворк"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"패치워크"}],"description":"In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn \"button income\": sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)&#10;&#10;When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2014},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":2},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":106,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":76}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":102},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":77}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":58,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":1},{"value":5,"numvotes":3},{"value":6,"numvotes":25},{"value":8,"numvotes":25},{"value":10,"numvotes":2},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":1}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":55,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":54},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":1},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":30},"minplaytime":{"value":15},"maxplaytime":{"value":30},"minage":{"value":8},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1009,"value":"Abstract Strategy"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1028,"value":"Puzzle"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2002,"value":"Tile Placement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2663,"value":"Time Track"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":26432,"value":"Combinatorial"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":33361,"value":"Lookout Games Fur Zwei Spieler Series"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":24571,"value":"Polyominoes"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":10,"value":"Uwe Rosenberg"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11507,"value":"Klemens Franz"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":234,"value":"Lookout Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":10,"value":"Mayfair Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":14813,"value":"Compaya.hu - Gamer Café Kft."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8832,"value":"Funforge"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6214,"value":"Kaissa Chess & Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8291,"value":"Korea Boardgames co., Ltd."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5812,"value":"Lacerta"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":30399,"value":"Ludicus"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":29242,"value":"Ludofy Creative"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":30677,"value":"Maldito Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7992,"value":"MINDOK"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7466,"value":"REBEL.pl"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17786,"value":"uplay.it edizioni"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":28082,"value":"Нескучные игры"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":22347,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic130601_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic130601.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Pecking Order"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Auf die Palme"}],"description":"Here is a description of the game from Spielbox:&#10;&#10;Pecking Order was first known as Auf die Palme (\"Onto the palm tree\" - This is a reference to the German proverb \"to bring someone onto the palm tree\").

simulates the sport of powerboat racing for 2 to 6 players using three-sided dice and an innovative rolling mechanic to simulate movement on the water.&#10;&#10;Players aim to score the most points over a series of three races using a double-sided modular board for easier or more difficult challenges, but they must also avoid damaging their boats too much.&#10;&#10;Once the board is set up buoys are placed to show the points the boats must pass during the race.  A player keeps the dice from their previous turn and may, if desired, add or subtract a die from these to accelerate or slow on their current turn.  Any or all dice used in the previous turn may be left at their current values or rerolled.  Once the roll is complete the player chooses a direction of travel, either straight or one hex side (60 degrees) to the left or right, and if the complete distance cannot be travelled the boat incurs damage.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2002},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":1162,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":5},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":606}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":65},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":362},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":373}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":254},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":692},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":50}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":754},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":302},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":313},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":554},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":99}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":20},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":468}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":253,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":1},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":1},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":12},{"value":10,"numvotes":64},{"value":12,"numvotes":97},{"value":14,"numvotes":58},{"value":16,"numvotes":14},{"value":18,"numvotes":4},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":1}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":308,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":9},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":109},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":171},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":18},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":1}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":150},"minplaytime":{"value":90},"maxplaytime":{"value":150},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1029,"value":"City Building"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1013,"value":"Farming"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2079,"value":"Variable Phase Order"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":58,"value":"Alea Big Box"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":21622,"value":"Colonial Theme"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10656,"value":"Country: Puerto Rico"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":9958,"value":"Puerto Rico"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":27646,"value":"Tableau Building"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":69178,"value":"Haiti (fan expansion for Puerto Rico)"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":12382,"value":"Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":159761,"value":"Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":40688,"value":"Treasure Chest"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":165332,"value":"Puerto Rico + Expansion I"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":108687,"value":"Puerto Rico: Limited Anniversary Edition"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":8217,"value":"San Juan"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":117,"value":"Andreas Seyfarth"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11883,"value":"Franz Vohwinkel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9,"value":"alea"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":34,"value":"Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4304,"value":"Albi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2366,"value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5657,"value":"Filosofia Éditions"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8820,"value":"Gém Klub Kft."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5530,"value":"Giochi Uniti"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6214,"value":"Kaissa Chess & Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5812,"value":"Lacerta"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3218,"value":"Lautapelit.fi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7992,"value":"MINDOK"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3888,"value":"Stratelibri"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9234,"value":"Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":42,"value":"Tilsit"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":109764,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1487289_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1487289.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Quarantine"},"description":"In Quarantine, players seek to build the biggest and most efficient hospital, while trying to keep ahead of the steady stream of incoming patients arriving at their doors.

It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&#10;&#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon \"mission\" card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&#10;&#10;This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&#10;&#10;Complete series overview -

Can you keep a poker face, but notice when another player looks pleased? Sharpen your memory and your timing, and have fun with the cool cats and bad rats of Rat-a-Tat Cat.  This is the Gamewright version.&#10;&#10;1996 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Republished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:&#10;&#10;Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 \"Exchange\", 7 \"Spy\", and 5 \"2 X draw\"). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the \"2X look\" card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1995},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":28,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":15}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":4},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":18},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":9},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":14},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":6},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":7},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":26,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":4},{"value":4,"numvotes":6},{"value":5,"numvotes":10},{"value":6,"numvotes":4},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":0},{"value":12,"numvotes":0},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":18,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":15},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":3},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":10},"minplaytime":{"value":10},"maxplaytime":{"value":10},"minage":{"value":6},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1089,"value":"Animals"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1041,"value":"Children's Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1045,"value":"Memory"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2047,"value":"Memory"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":14694,"value":"Animals: Beavers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":7334,"value":"Animals: Cats"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":7520,"value":"Animals: Rats"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":6485,"value":"Mensa Select"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":212663,"value":"Biberbande Schnupperspiel"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":17521,"value":"Golf","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":257,"value":"Monty Stambler"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":258,"value":"Ann Stambler"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12024,"value":"Björn Pertoft"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":36633,"value":"Roni Shepherd"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12038,"value":"Markus Wagner"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4304,"value":"Albi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8,"value":"AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":10505,"value":"Art Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2378,"value":"Copag - Cia.

The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there&rsquo;s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions).

Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&#10;&#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then \"spent\" to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&#10;&#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&#10;&#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&#10;&#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2012},"minplayers":{"value":3},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":80,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":47}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":51}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":56}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":46},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":16}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":21},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":34},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":69},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":29}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":16,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":0},{"value":12,"numvotes":9},{"value":14,"numvotes":6},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":24,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":2},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":16},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":6},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":120},"minplaytime":{"value":120},"maxplaytime":{"value":120},"minage":{"value":14},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1026,"value":"Negotiation"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1001,"value":"Political"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2012,"value":"Auction/Bidding"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2019,"value":"Partnerships"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2078,"value":"Point to Point Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":29,"value":"Twilight Imperium"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":121,"value":"Dune","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":34,"value":"Bill Eberle"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":7483,"value":"John Goodenough"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":35,"value":"Jack Kittredge"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":6651,"value":"Corey Konieczka"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":36,"value":"Peter Olotka"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":21,"value":"Christian T.

Now imagine that you're bored.  So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies.  Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory.  The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera.  But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's \"registers\" with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course.

The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.&#10;&#10;While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven card widths apart from each other. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&#10;&#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&#10;&#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins.

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and \"violet\" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2004},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":275,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":143}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":74},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":159},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":18}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":146},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":93},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":98},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":117},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":17}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":117}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":52,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":1},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":11},{"value":10,"numvotes":28},{"value":12,"numvotes":11},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":72,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":1},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":9},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":47},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":15},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":45},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1029,"value":"City Building"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2079,"value":"Variable Phase Order"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":60,"value":"Alea Small Box"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":21622,"value":"Colonial Theme"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10656,"value":"Country: Puerto Rico"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":9958,"value":"Puerto Rico"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":27646,"value":"Tableau Building"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":165355,"value":"San Juan: The New Buildings & The Events"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":40688,"value":"Treasure Chest"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":166669,"value":"San Juan (second edition)"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":3076,"value":"Puerto Rico","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":117,"value":"Andreas Seyfarth"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11883,"value":"Franz Vohwinkel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9,"value":"alea"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9068,"value":"Broadway Toys LTD"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2366,"value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5657,"value":"Filosofia Éditions"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3504,"value":"Möbius Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":34,"value":"Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9234,"value":"Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":33604,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2444563_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2444563.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Say Anything"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Besta svarið"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Sano Suoraan!"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Sig Noget!"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Zeg't Maar!"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Znáš Mě?"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"無所不言"}],"description":"Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think.

Powerful sorcerers, mythical beasts, epic monuments, and grand armies all play key roles in the Scarab Lords card game.&#10;&#10;The non-collectible card game features two beautifully illustrated 30 card decks which players must customize to best fit their strategies.&#10;&#10;Sequel: Minotaur Lords&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2002},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":2},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":18,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":12}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":16},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":6,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":4},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":11,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":8},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":3},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":30},"minplaytime":{"value":30},"maxplaytime":{"value":30},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1050,"value":"Ancient"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1010,"value":"Fantasy"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2664,"value":"Deck / Pool Building"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":22783,"value":"Admin: Better Description Needed!"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":3400,"value":"Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games"},{"type":"boardgameintegration","id":10908,"value":"Minotaur Lords"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":2,"value":"Reiner Knizia"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":14564,"value":"V.

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow & Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood. The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1948},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":182,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":116}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":132},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":43},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":38},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":95},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":30}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":39},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":76},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":46}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":6},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":119}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":61,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":1},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":4},{"value":8,"numvotes":22},{"value":10,"numvotes":19},{"value":12,"numvotes":11},{"value":14,"numvotes":4},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":96,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":13},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":5},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":2},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":4},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":72}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":90},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1025,"value":"Word Game"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2002,"value":"Tile Placement"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10149,"value":"Hasbro Nostalgia Series"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":11505,"value":"Promotional Board Games"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":4711,"value":"Scrabble"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":160001,"value":"Family Game Night Book and Game Set: Scrabble, Clue, Sorry, Yahtzee"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":147369,"value":"Scrabble and Yahtzee"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":13464,"value":"Alfapet"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":130207,"value":"Scrabble Limited Too Collector's Edition"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":143,"value":"Alfred Mosher Butts"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":67649,"value":"C.

At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!&#10;&#10;Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:&#10;&#10;The first phase \"Prelude\" consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.&#10;&#10;Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate his 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. He will begin the second phase of the game with his first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, he will receive the other two packets of three cards.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).&#10;&#10;These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: &#10;- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) &#10;- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards&#10;- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. &#10;- Draw new cards&#10;&#10;Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the \"time track\" would move forward.&#10;In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the \"exchange rates\" of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable).

The rules have been updated and the game is more fluid.&#10;&#10;In Serenissima players represent a merchant family during the Renaissance. Players attempt to balance the need of trading and open commerce versus the cut-throat economic piracy of the day. Players create a fleet of ships to purchase and move various commodities around the Mediterranean while also keeping well manned ships to attack and defend against other player's fleets.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(block of information submitted by user in comments not included in game entry)&#10;Board&#10;The maritime areas are bigger and there are fewer of them. Starting ports are different too: Alexandria is one of them in the new version.Resources and Trade&#10;One of the resources has changed (marble replaces gems) and the ports produce different resources compared to the 1996 version. In the 1996 version, when buying goods from a port owned by another player, you had to bargain. It could be hard. Now, you just pay them 1 ducat, instead of paying the bank.&#10;Wine is now special: one port with wine in its warehouse is worth more VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Flow (big point)&#10;In the 1996 version, all the players used to bid for turn order. Then, they all played the phases according to this order: they loaded, built and bought, then they all moved their galleys, they fought and finally they took over free ports and made money.&#10;There's no bidding anymore. Now, the galleys you build are numbered, and when it's the turn of one specific galley, its owner can perform their actions (load, move and fight, or build), before the next galley is the active one. If your galleys have successive numbers, you can play several times.&#10;The little flags that used to be awkwardly fixed on the galleys are now useless, and the men have to be in the player's colour (instead of being a nice bunch of nice Sailor Smurfs).&#10;This is a major difference, the game is radically altered.&#10;&#10;Counts and Victory Points&#10;There are several counts in the game, and not only one at the end of the game. What's more: another kind of count can bring players money if they have wine in their warehouse. All of that depends on the drawn cards at the end of a galleys' turn. The pace of the game may be altered by those cards, too.&#10;There is no card in the 1996 version.&#10;In this old version, the only way to have your port well valued at the end of the game was to have its warehouses full. It's now different too: a port with one good is better than one with none, but worse than one with two, etc.&#10;&#10;Other Changes&#10;There's a building more: basilic. It brings more VP.&#10;Galleys are easier to build but the price is not the same.&#10;Combat rules are very different, the fort has a different power. Dice are different too.&#10;Port limits to recruit sailors are different.&#10;2 and 3 players rules are different.&#10;...and this list is all but exhaustive.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2012},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":21,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":12},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":15},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":7}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":6,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":2},{"value":12,"numvotes":3},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":9,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":9},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":90},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":13},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1008,"value":"Nautical"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1070,"value":"Renaissance"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2019,"value":"Partnerships"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2007,"value":"Pick-up and Deliver"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2008,"value":"Trading"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":17740,"value":"Cities: Venice"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":232,"value":"Serenissima (first edition)","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":79,"value":"Dominique Ehrhard"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12886,"value":"Arnaud Demaegd"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":79,"value":"Dominique Ehrhard"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":157,"value":"Asmodee"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9235,"value":"Stupor Mundi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2861,"value":"Ystari Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":15062,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic70547_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic70547.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Shadows over Camelot"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":5,"value":"Les Chevaliers de la Table Ronde"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Cienie nad Camelot"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Schatten über Camelot"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"シャドウズ・オーバー・キャメロット"}],"description":"Shadows over Camelot is a cooperative/semi-cooperative hand-management and deduction-based board game for 3&ndash;7 players.&#10;&#10;Each player represents a knight of the Round Table and they must collaborate to overcome a number of quests, ranging from defeating the Black Knight to the search for the Holy Grail.

Your meager beginnings will influence the paths you must take. Lead your people well and they will take you to infinite heights of greatness. If civilization manages to endure the ages, your name will hang in every whisper of its legacy...&#10;&#10;Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization: The Board Game! Forge an empire to stand the test of time using innovative game mechanics with multiple paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Will you lead the greatest army in the world to conquer your foes? Or will you be the first to journey to the stars, becoming the most technologically advanced civilization known to man? The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Designed by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people&rsquo;s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.&#10;&#10;In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!&#10;&#10;Fans of Sid Meier&rsquo;s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play, Civilization: The Board Game captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.&#10;&#10;Players start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.&#10;&#10;Those unfamiliar with the video game series will find Civilization: The Board Game a great way to enter into the world of Civilization. The strategy and tactical decisions involved in Civilization: The Board Game will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2010},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":286,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":129}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":24},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":135},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":58}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":48},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":154},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":18}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":190},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":54},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":5},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":80}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":84,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":19},{"value":14,"numvotes":40},{"value":16,"numvotes":16},{"value":18,"numvotes":3},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":1}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":120,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":1},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

You attempt to have the most power on the Base from your minions when the Base is smashed. Sounds easy?  How easy is it when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to Beam Up your minions to other Bases - flat out Assassinate them? What about when the Pirate-Dinosaur player Full Sails in and releases King Rex to stomp your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies use their Mystic Power to create an Outbreak, suddenly flooding minions onto the Base from the discard pile? Or what if you faced a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an Outbreak of massive beasts all at once?!?&#10;&#10;When a Base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, bro &ndash; try harder next time.&#10;&#10;With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try.

It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).&#10;&#10;You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The GeneStealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.&#10;&#10;The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.&#10;&#10;The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.&#10;&#10;There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.&#10;&#10;Even with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;Space Hulk (2nd Edition)&#10;Space Hulk (3rd Edition)&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1989},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":40,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":21}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":36},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":17},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":5},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":17}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":19}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":10,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":3},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":2},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":8,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":3},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":2},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":3},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":45},"minplaytime":{"value":45},"maxplaytime":{"value":45},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1047,"value":"Miniatures"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2001,"value":"Action Point Allowance System"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2676,"value":"Grid Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2011,"value":"Modular Board"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":3351,"value":"Space Hulk"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":4329,"value":"Warhammer 40,000 Board Games"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":15401,"value":"Space Hulk Campaigns"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":13315,"value":"Space Hulk: Deathwing Expansion"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":13393,"value":"Space Hulk: Genestealer Expansion"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":165838,"value":"Space Hulk (fourth edition)"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":63091,"value":"Space Hulk (second edition)"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":54625,"value":"Space Hulk (third edition)"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":153,"value":"Richard Halliwell"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":31506,"value":"Tony Cottrell"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":14937,"value":"Wayne England"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12370,"value":"David Gallagher"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12430,"value":"Jes Goodwin"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":14763,"value":"Gerry Grace"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12236,"value":"Bob Naismith"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1869,"value":"Diseños Orbitales"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":26,"value":"Games Workshop Ltd."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":16358,"value":"ISA"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":307,"value":"Welt der Spiele"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":155624,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2486481_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2486481.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Specter Ops"},"description":"A secret agent of A.R.K. has infiltrated a top secret Raxxon facility, attempting to complete three mission objectives before they escape &mdash; but they are hunted by genetically modified Raxxon Hunters.

Alternatively, Spyrium can be purchased, but the material is rare and expensive, and players are constantly scraping for money.&#10;&#10;Only those who from the beginning of the game manage to increase their regular income or their base of permanently employed workers (who can be used again and again to raise money) will be flexible enough to get their hands on the important end-of-game buildings to generate many VPs.&#10;&#10;The circular nature of the game is flexible as each player can decide for himself when to move out of the placement phase and into the activation phase. With the two tracks in the game, those involved with delivery during the worker phase can then be used to raise money, to purchase an adjacent card, or to work on their own in an idle factory. All of these things are important, but in the end only the player who has dealt best with the lack of money, workers, and Spyrium will win.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2013},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":100,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":39}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":10},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":51},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":23}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":32},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":42},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":53},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":28},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":13},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":45},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":12}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":32}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":18,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":11},{"value":14,"numvotes":3},{"value":16,"numvotes":1},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":33,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":33},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":75},"minplaytime":{"value":75},"maxplaytime":{"value":75},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1029,"value":"City Building"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1088,"value":"Industry / Manufacturing"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2082,"value":"Worker Placement"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":14759,"value":"Country: England"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5610,"value":"Steampunk"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":187,"value":"Ystari originals"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":5629,"value":"William Attia"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12886,"value":"Arnaud Demaegd"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":39783,"value":"Neriac"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":157,"value":"Asmodee"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2861,"value":"Ystari Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":164153,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2247647_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2247647.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: Imperial Assault"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: Assalto Imperiale"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: Assaut sur l'Empire"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: Imperium Atakuje"}],"description":"Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2014},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players!&#10;&#10;Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2016},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":108,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":59}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":99},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":46}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":43},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":31}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":55}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":31,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":7},{"value":12,"numvotes":8},{"value":14,"numvotes":12},{"value":16,"numvotes":2},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":22,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":3},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":19},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":240},"minplaytime":{"value":180},"maxplaytime":{"value":240},"minage":{"value":14},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1064,"value":"Movies / TV / Radio theme"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1019,"value":"Wargame"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":25158,"value":"Components: Miniatures"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":9983,"value":"Fantasy Flight Big Box"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5602,"value":"Star Wars"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":6651,"value":"Corey Konieczka"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":15889,"value":"Asterion Press"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2973,"value":"Edge Entertainment"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17,"value":"Fantasy Flight Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4617,"value":"Galakta"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":264,"value":"Heidelberger Spieleverlag"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":103885,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1603292_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1603292.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars X-Wing: El juego de miniaturas – Caja Básica"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing Gioco di Miniature"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing Gra Figurkowa"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing Jogo de Miniaturas"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing Miniaturen-Spiel Basis-Set"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game – Core Set"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing Игра с миниатюрами"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing – Le Jeu de Figurines"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-Wing 미니어처 게임"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Star Wars: X-翼戰機 核心裝"}],"description":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!&#10;&#10;Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...&#10;&#10;The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2012},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of

In this management game, you'll have to build your own amusement park and make it the largest and most profitable in the region. By constructing the three-dimensional, wonderful rides designed by Marie Cardouat, you will see your park grow right before your eyes. Choose your strategy! Build Stands to attract more Visitors, or Toilets to keep the Dirt under control. Whatever decision you take, take it quickly: The less time you spend planning, the more time you'll have to maintain your park.

Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.&#10;&#10;Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts. Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player's damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention. These will need to be replaced in the draft phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":8},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":43,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":19}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":12},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":12},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":7}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":18},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":15},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":21},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":3}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":19},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":3}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":10},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":13},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":8,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":5},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":"8+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":16}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":19,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":8},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":7},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":17,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.&#10;&#10;Secretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.&#10;&#10;Once the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.&#10;&#10;You control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could \"blast\" your man off the board and out of play.&#10;&#10;The first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!&#10;&#10;This game is similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the H.P. Gibsons (UK) game L'Attaque (1909). It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) This game in turn almost certainly drew on the classic Chinese children's game Jungle.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire & Ice)&#10;     The Generals&#10;     Stratego Legends&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars&#10;     Stratego: The Lord of the Rings&#10;     Ultimate Stratego&#10;     Electronic Stratego&#10;     Stratego: Marvel Heroes&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition&#10;     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;and numerous others.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Admirals&#10;    Lu Zhan Jun Qi&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Batalj&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Different Edition Complications&#10;When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.&#10;When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....&#10;Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.&#10;This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)

Sun Tzu and his Wu soldiers were outnumbered and King Shao's armies held the high ground. Sun Tzu feigned retreat and tricked King Shao into spreading out his forces, ready to pursue. With the Ch'u scattered, Sun Tzu crushed their forces in piecemeal fashion at the battle of Bai Ju, routing the Ch'u back to their capital of Ying. King Shao fled Ying seeking refuge and asylum across the borders while Sun Tzu remained the master of strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In Sun Tzu, a.k.a. Dynasties, players take on the role of Sun Tzu or King Shao, leading these two opposing armies in an attempt to unify China through the deployment of their armies and forces rather than by brute force. Each turn players play cards to specific provinces, then reveal them individually by province. Armies are added or removed from the province depending on who played the higher valued card or who played a special card. Some cards can only be used once, so playing the card at the correct time is critical to a winning strategy. The game has a feel of \"tug-of-war\" as the scoring marker starts in the middle of the scoring scale and the players attempt to move the marker to their side of the track. The game ends after nine rounds or if either player is able to move the scoring marker to the last space on his side of the scoring track.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2005},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":2},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":15,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":13},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"2+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":3,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":6,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":3},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":3},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":30},"minplaytime":{"value":30},"maxplaytime":{"value":30},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1050,"value":"Ancient"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2020,"value":"Simultaneous Action Selection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":11518,"value":"Country: China"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":20788,"value":"Matagot Duo Collection"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":205,"value":"Al Newman"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":16305,"value":"Rolland Barthélémy"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":74048,"value":"Tomasz Larek"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12627,"value":"Jacob Walker"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":26380,"value":"Foxgames (Poland)"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":206,"value":"Jolly Roger Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5400,"value":"Matagot"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":92190,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1001002_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1001002.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Super Dungeon Explore"},"description":"Super Dungeon Explore (SDE) is a dungeon crawler inspired by old Japanese console RPGs.

During a round of play, the game passes back and forth between single heroes and the monsters, but the exact order may change from round to round. The characters use the stats from their character card, special dice (with hearts, potions and stars) are only used for combat and checks. If the heroes wound the opponent, they may draw loot cards to improve their stats. There is also the possibility to open treasure chests to find even more powerful things. The monsters have no possibility to \"level up\" apart from a single late game upgrade but the Dark Consul has an unlimited number of them.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the Dark Consul must defeat all heroes in his dungeon. The heroes must spawn the dungeon boss by killing monsters or destroying all spawning points (= entry points for new monsters).

Will you be remembered as the greatest Solarus Corporation employee in the galaxy?&#10;&#10;Super Motherload is a tile-laying deck-building game, which means that you have your own deck of cards from which you draw each turn. The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it. You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you've collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Super Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":33,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":18},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":6,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":11,"results":{"result":[{"level":21,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":6},{"level":22,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":5},{"level":23,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":24,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":25,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":75},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":75},"minage":{"value":13},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1101,"value":"Video Game Theme"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2664,"value":"Deck / Pool Building"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2002,"value":"Tile Placement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":4705,"value":"Games by the Game Artisans of Canada"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10169,"value":"Mars"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":21425,"value":"Mining"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":32887,"value":"Gavan Brown"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":32943,"value":"Matt Tolman"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":32887,"value":"Gavan Brown"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":70571,"value":"Lina Cossette"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":70568,"value":"David Forest"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":21765,"value":"Roxley Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":29907,"value":"Games Factory Publishing"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":2653,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1300182_t.png","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1300182.png","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Survive: Escape from Atlantis!"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Atlantis"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":5,"value":"The Island"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Ostrov"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Si salvi chi può!"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Survive!"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Survive: Fuga de Atlântida!"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Survivre!"}],"description":"Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.&#10;&#10;An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board).

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of \"decksploration\". Each player is free to give their character as deep a \"role\" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a \"run\"; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&#10;&#10;In the box, an insert allows players to \"save\" the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&#10;&#10;Official FAQ&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":131,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":12},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":65}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":31},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":53}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":8},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":64},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":96},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":20},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":42}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":43,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":10},{"value":14,"numvotes":18},{"value":16,"numvotes":12},{"value":18,"numvotes":1},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":1}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":50,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":1},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1994},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":10},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":218,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":131}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":42},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":124}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":13},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":78},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":81}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":55},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":111},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":25}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":122},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":66},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":111},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":77},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":61},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":103},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":14}]},{"numplayers":8,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":46},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":106},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":23}]},{"numplayers":9,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":17},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":102},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":42}]},{"numplayers":10,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":20},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":96},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":47}]},{"numplayers":"10+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":95}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":57,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":1},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":1},{"value":6,"numvotes":14},{"value":8,"numvotes":38},{"value":10,"numvotes":3},{"value":12,"numvotes":0},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":83,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":82},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":1}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":45},"minplaytime":{"value":45},"maxplaytime":{"value":45},"minage":{"value":8},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2020,"value":"Simultaneous Action Selection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5012,"value":"6 nimmt!"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":7530,"value":"Animals: Cattle"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":6485,"value":"Mensa Select"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":20030,"value":"6 nimmt!

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.&#10;&#10;In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.)

Once peaceful and neighborly, the Masters of the competing mountain-folk train their students and send them out across bridges to control neighboring villages. To take control of a village, the students must come together in uncomfortable alliances, regardless of their tribal origin. Eventually students become Masters themselves, train new students and expand to other villages.&#10;&#10;There is one thing each student must keep in mind as they travel from village to village -- the mystical powers of Shangri-La mysteriously cause the bridges to collapse, separating villages forever. One crucial question will decide the winner: who will control the most Masters of Shangri-La?&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of leaders of a specific tribe. There is a battle raging over the empty villages of the land and players must quickly fill those villages with their tribal leaders. As players migrate tribal leaders from one village to the next, they must not become too weak or they risk losing leaders to opposing tribes.

Functionally, this is essentially a military game.  Players either spend their turn reinforcing a village (adding more tokens there) or invading a neighboring village (expanding influence if you have more total tokens than the victim).  The unique twist is that, after each invasion, the connecting bridge is removed.  So over the course of the game, attack options become more and more limited, until the game naturally comes to a conclusion.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2003},"minplayers":{"value":3},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":46,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":19}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":19}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":16},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":22},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":30},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":17}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":9,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":4},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":12,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":12},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1009,"value":"Abstract Strategy"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1086,"value":"Territory Building"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1097,"value":"Travel"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2080,"value":"Area Control / Area Influence"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2078,"value":"Point to Point Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2002,"value":"Tile Placement"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":22783,"value":"Admin: Better Description Needed!"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":6485,"value":"Mensa Select"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":138,"value":"Leo Colovini"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11478,"value":"Alvin Madden"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":22516,"value":"Anke Pohl"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":22515,"value":"Thilo Rick"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":855,"value":"Andreas Steiner"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":28164,"value":"Imelda Vohwinkel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":37,"value":"KOSMOS"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1901,"value":"Überplay"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":84876,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176894_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176894.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":5,"value":"The Castles of Burgundy"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":5,"value":"Die Burgen von Burgund"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":5,"value":"Les Châteaux de Bourgogne"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Zamki Burgundii"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Замки Бургундии"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"勃根地城堡"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"勃根地城堡"}],"description":"The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2011},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":605,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":18},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":268}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":365},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":179},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":18}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":178},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":305},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":109},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":237},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":130}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":237}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":103,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":2},{"value":8,"numvotes":12},{"value":10,"numvotes":23},{"value":12,"numvotes":49},{"value":14,"numvotes":16},{"value":16,"numvotes":1},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":119,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":108},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

Players start from a base and explore a cave, tunnel after tunnel, effectively building the board (the cave). They have to overcome steep descents, underground lakes, and tight squeezes. They will be given a chance to admire the wonders of the underground, like halls full of stalactites. To make it all possible they must take the right supplies with them, like ropes, oxygen and batteries.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have five action points to use for moving, discovering new cave tiles, exploring them, and packing their backpacks when they go back to the starting base. They need ropes for descents, oxygen to explore underwater parts, and a camera to photograph underground wonders. Planning what to take with them is one of the most important things in the game. Each turn that their pawn is not in the starting base, players must use (i.e., throw out) one basic supply from their backpack; these costs, along with the expenditure of other supplies during exploration, forces them to return to the starting base a few times during the game. To keep them from having to carry everything, though, players can raise a camp somewhere in the tunnels where they can store some of the equipment.&#10;&#10;The cave differs every game, so players have to be prepared for everything or they will lose time. Players earn points for exploring different tiles: underwater, wondrous, descents, and so on &ndash; but to win they'll need to acquire bonus prizes for exploring the most tiles of each type. This make decision-making during trips very difficult.&#10;&#10;When the cave is fully explored, the player who made the biggest effort in the most spectacular way wins the game.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2012},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":24,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":14}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":13},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":4},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":12,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":6},{"value":10,"numvotes":5},{"value":12,"numvotes":0},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":20,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":20},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1084,"value":"Environmental"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1020,"value":"Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1059,"value":"Maze"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1097,"value":"Travel"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2001,"value":"Action Point Allowance System"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2011,"value":"Modular Board"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2002,"value":"Tile Placement"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":132444,"value":"The Cave: Additional Cave Tiles"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":7324,"value":"Adam Kałuża"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":38447,"value":"Jarek Nocoń"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":39,"value":"Pegasus Spiele"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7466,"value":"REBEL.pl"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17786,"value":"uplay.it edizioni"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":23181,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509228_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic509228.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":5,"value":"The Da Vinci Code Board Game: The Quest for the Truth"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Da Vinci Code Le Jeu"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Da Vinci Code: Het Bordspel"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":5,"value":"The daVinci Code: Sakrileg"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Κωδικας Da Vinci: Το παιχνιδι"}],"description":"This is a new game inspired by the bestselling novel of the same name and licensed by the film company that is making the movie based on the Da Vinci code book. The game includes 15 different mysteries for players to solve and uses some clever tools that players must employ to solve the mysteries. An instructional DVD that explains the game and shows an example mystery being solved is also included.&#10;&#10;There are 2 phases to the game. In the first phase players roll and move their pieces around the board to visit various sites to look at clue cards so they can figure out the mystery phrase first. Each of these clues require a different mechanism to solve. Some use a mirror to reverse the letters, some use a decoder box that is laid over the card in a certain way to reveal part of the mystery phrase, some cards you line up against a special decoder tool, and some are just riddles or puzzles to solve. Some clues will also require the player to do to the center of the board and visit the library to retrieve a card there with information that will help them solve their clue. Alternately, players might need to visit the Louvre and examine a painting there. When the players visit the Louvre the players only have 30 seconds to find the correct card with the painting that relates to their clue, examine the painting and the information on the card about the painting and hopefully discover the information they need to solve their current clue.&#10;&#10;Players can also discover one of two special types of cards: Taxis which let the player move around board quicker and a computer card that lets you look at another player's notes for 30 seconds.&#10;&#10;Once one player thinks they have solved the Mystery Phrase they go to the center of the board and announce the answer. If they are right then all players score 1 point for each letter (and blank space) they had correct in the Mystery Phrase. The player that got the Mystery Phrase correct gets 5 bonus points.&#10;&#10;This begins Phase 2 of the game as 5 questions are now read from the mystery book. These questions relate to the clues that the players discovered during the game. Each question a player gets right is worth 5 points. If a player gets all 5 questions correct they score another 5 points.&#10;&#10;Players lose points for any Taxi or Computer cards they had left in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2006},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":3,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":3}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":2,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":4,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":1},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":3}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":120},"minplaytime":{"value":120},"maxplaytime":{"value":120},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1039,"value":"Deduction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1045,"value":"Memory"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1040,"value":"Murder/Mystery"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1093,"value":"Novel-based"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2047,"value":"Memory"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2035,"value":"Roll / Spin and Move"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":27580,"value":"Leonardo da Vinci"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":37585,"value":"Da Vinci Code: Het Bordspel – 5 Nieuwe Mysteries"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":7092,"value":"Terry Miller Associates"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5384,"value":"Columbia Pictures"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":51,"value":"Hasbro"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1613,"value":"Identity Games International B.V."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3905,"value":"Mega Brands"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6876,"value":"Nilco S.A."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":664,"value":"RoseArt"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9466,"value":"Winning Moves France"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":26208,"value":"Winning Moves Germany (Winning Moves Deutschland GmbH)"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":36235,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1688903_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1688903.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":5,"value":"The Duke"},"description":"Levy.

Each side represents a different posture &ndash; often considered to be defensive or offensive &ndash; and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture.&#10;&#10;Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack. The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on. Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent's tiles. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent's tile, you capture that tile. Capture your opponent's Duke to win!&#10;&#10;Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board. Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke. Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag. With fifteen different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and nineteen total pieces for each player (plus special optional tiles), the variety of game play is limitless.&#10;&#10;Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board.

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck.

The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. The five main actions are shown on the bottom part of the board:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Get resources with 1-3 dice, depending on the value of the resource (camels, pepper, silk, gold). The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take one resource of your choice and two camels. Each player sets the minimum value for the future dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Earn money, with any one die netting you five money.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Purchase orders: The value of one die unlocks the orders up to that number (shown on the spaces) and allows you to buy one or two of those orders. Orders are refreshed and placed at the beginning of each round. To fulfill an order, players have to spend resources for victory points, other resources, camels, and more.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Travel: Two dice are placed to unlock the distance that can be traveled on the upper part of the board, that is, the map. Here, the traveler piece of each player starts at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a traveler stops at a city, they place a marker there, giving them access to a different additional action for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving victory points for arriving in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having reached the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game; these points are added to the VPs gained during the game.&#10;&#10;Auf den Spuren von Marco Polo should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which had the same German title.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":143,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":61}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":14},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":99},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":39},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":76},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":75},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":42},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":42}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":28,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":1},{"value":10,"numvotes":12},{"value":12,"numvotes":12},{"value":14,"numvotes":2},{"value":16,"numvotes":1},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":47,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":43},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":4},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":100},"minplaytime":{"value":40},"maxplaytime":{"value":100},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1017,"value":"Dice"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1035,"value":"Medieval"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1097,"value":"Travel"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2078,"value":"Point to Point Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2082,"value":"Worker Placement"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":6480,"value":"Animals: Camels"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":186554,"value":"The Voyages of Marco Polo: The New Characters"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":35418,"value":"Simone Luciani"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":59986,"value":"Daniele Tascini"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12484,"value":"Dennis Lohausen"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":133,"value":"Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4304,"value":"Albi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3475,"value":"Arclight"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2366,"value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5657,"value":"Filosofia Éditions"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":5530,"value":"Giochi Uniti"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9234,"value":"Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":538,"value":"Z-Man Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":30869,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2723204_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2723204.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Thebes"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Jenseits von Theben"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Teby"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Théba"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Théby"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"テーベ"}],"description":"Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in \"time\". So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the \"time\" to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure.

In every game Theseus looks different; in every game it's deadly for you in a new way...&#10;&#10;Rules for team play allow players to engage in incredibly emotional 2-vs-2 battles. With perfectly balanced factions, players will be able to fight engaging and deadly battles as a teams. Each faction has a unique deck of cards, and before the game starts, you discard ten cards from the deck. In basic mode you discard at random, while in tournament (master) mode you choose cards and build your deck. With five factions and 110 cards, the game can provide years of unique experiences.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2013},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":57,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":25}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":48},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":18}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":25}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":24}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":11,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":5},{"value":12,"numvotes":4},{"value":14,"numvotes":2},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":12,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":10},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":1},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":1}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":45},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":8},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2019,"value":"Partnerships"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2078,"value":"Point to Point Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":164931,"value":"Theseus: The Dark Orbit – Bots"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":182515,"value":"Theseus: The Dark Orbit – Hunters"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":149345,"value":"Theseus: The Dark Orbit – Space Station Cards"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":5143,"value":"Michał Oracz"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":38917,"value":"Mateusz Bielski"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":39040,"value":"Piotr Foksowicz"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12019,"value":"Tomasz Jedruszek"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":69434,"value":"Maciej Mutwil"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2726,"value":"Portal Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8923,"value":"IELLO"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":39,"value":"Pegasus Spiele"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":182028,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2663291_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2663291.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Cywilizacja: Poprzez Wieki"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Im Wandel der Zeitalter: Ein neue Geschichte der Zivilisation"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Korokon át: A civilizáció új története"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Korokon át: A civilizáció új története"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages: Eine neue Geschichte der Zivilisation"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages: L'Histoire vous appartient"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages: Nový příběh civilizace"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages: Nový příběh civilizace"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages: Rivivi la Storia della Civiltà"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Through the Ages: Una Nueva Historia de la Civilización"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"历史巨轮：人类文明新篇章"}],"description":"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.&#10;&#10;Through the Ages is a civilization building game.

The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.&#10; In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.&#10; Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.&#10;&#10;Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1998},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":5},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":183,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":91}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":57},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":94},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":106},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":51},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":59},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":77},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":13}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":10},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":75},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":48}]},{"numplayers":"5+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":84}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":32,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":4},{"value":6,"numvotes":3},{"value":8,"numvotes":14},{"value":10,"numvotes":8},{"value":12,"numvotes":3},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":48,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":48},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":45},"minplaytime":{"value":45},"maxplaytime":{"value":45},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1009,"value":"Abstract Strategy"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1089,"value":"Animals"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1052,"value":"Arabian"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2043,"value":"Area Enclosure"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2081,"value":"Route/Network Building"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":6480,"value":"Animals: Camels"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":13265,"value":"Desert Theme"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":3400,"value":"Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":42,"value":"Knizia tile-laying trilogy"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":2,"value":"Reiner Knizia"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12508,"value":"John Gravato"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":12017,"value":"Scott Nicely"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11989,"value":"Brian Schomburg"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11902,"value":"Claus Stephan"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6194,"value":"Delta Vision Publishing"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2973,"value":"Edge Entertainment"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17,"value":"Fantasy Flight Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4617,"value":"Galakta"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1391,"value":"Hobby Japan"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":37,"value":"KOSMOS"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3218,"value":"Lautapelit.fi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2962,"value":"PS-Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8266,"value":"Silver Stars Publishing"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8759,"value":"Wargames Club Publishing"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":21790,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic115300_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic115300.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Thurn and Taxis"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Cesarski Kurier"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Poštovní Kurýr"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Poštovní kurýr"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Thurn & Taxis"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Thurn et Taxis: l'aventure postale"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Thurn und Taxis"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Турн и Таксис.

The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&#10;&#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities.  Each route must consist of at least three cities.  Players may only build one route at a time.  Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&#10;&#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card.  The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards.  On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one.  If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it.  The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage.  Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route.  Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.&#10;&#10;When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered.  Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends.  Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices.  The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2006},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":237,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":115}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":64},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":126},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":26}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":117},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":87},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":119},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":74},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":9}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":93}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":49,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":2},{"value":8,"numvotes":13},{"value":10,"numvotes":25},{"value":12,"numvotes":9},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":72,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":61},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":9},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":1},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":1}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":60},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":13},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1070,"value":"Renaissance"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1011,"value":"Transportation"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2081,"value":"Route/Network Building"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":10643,"value":"Country: Germany"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":9016,"value":"Thurn and Taxis"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":33261,"value":"Thurn and Taxis: All Roads Lead to Rome"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":27690,"value":"Thurn and Taxis: Power and Glory"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":25293,"value":"Thurn und Taxis: Der Kurier der Fürstin"},{"type":"boardgamecompilation","id":151377,"value":"Thurn und Taxis Big Box"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":117,"value":"Andreas Seyfarth"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":6569,"value":"Karen Seyfarth"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11825,"value":"Michael Menzel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":267,"value":"999 Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":4304,"value":"Albi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9074,"value":"Bard Centrum Gier"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":133,"value":"Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":18852,"value":"Hobby World"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3218,"value":"Lautapelit.fi"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":7992,"value":"MINDOK"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3,"value":"Rio Grande Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":38,"value":"Schmidt Spiele"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8313,"value":"Smart Ltd"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":215,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic169494_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic169494.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Tichu"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Tai Pan"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Тичу"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Тичу"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"地主"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"티츄"}],"description":"Tichu is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team.

At the start of a round, each player can call \"Tichu\" prior to her playing any card. This indicates that she thinks that she can empty her hand first this round; if she does so, her team scores 100 points, and if not, it loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call \"Grand Tichu\" after looking at only her first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1991},"minplayers":{"value":3},"maxplayers":{"value":10},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":232,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":155}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":153}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":159}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":215},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":16},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":157}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":145}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":147}]},{"numplayers":8,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]},{"numplayers":9,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]},{"numplayers":10,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]},{"numplayers":"10+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":8}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":43,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":2},{"value":8,"numvotes":3},{"value":10,"numvotes":9},{"value":12,"numvotes":23},{"value":14,"numvotes":3},{"value":16,"numvotes":2},{"value":18,"numvotes":1},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":62,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":62},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&#10;&#10;\"The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,\" says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R.

the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144

In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.&#10;&#10;All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2011},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":164,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":59}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":38},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":83},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":13}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":48},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":79},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":79},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":40},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":44}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":25,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":12},{"value":14,"numvotes":9},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":50,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":48},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":1},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":1}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":90},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1050,"value":"Ancient"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1001,"value":"Political"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2046,"value":"Area Movement"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2041,"value":"Card Drafting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2004,"value":"Set Collection"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5606,"value":"Ancient Rome"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":129,"value":"Quined Master Print Edition Series"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":4958,"value":"Stefan Feld"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":962,"value":"Jo Hartwig"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17551,"value":"Ammonit Spiele"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":15889,"value":"Asterion Press"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1280,"value":"FoxMind"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":155,"value":"Gigamic"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":3490,"value":"HUCH! & friends"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9382,"value":"Hutter Trade GmbH + Co KG"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":23296,"value":"Passport Game Studios"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":10663,"value":"Quined Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":149328,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1873618_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1873618.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Trivial Pursuit: Party"},"description":"Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Get into a challenging battle of wits in a whole new way with this updated version of the classic Trivial Pursuit game!

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the \"many roads that lead to divine wisdom\", and the game as a whole representing \"the classic quest for enlightenment\".&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.

Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from 'Puerto Rico' to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of 'Settlers of Catan', while the \"Command\" system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of 'Attack' to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium (second edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire&#10;    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2005},"minplayers":{"value":3},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":436,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":238}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":18},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":241}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":17},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":131},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":169}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":98},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":226},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":42}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":54},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":234},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":51}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":309},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":74},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":41},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":66},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":99}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":153,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":5},{"value":12,"numvotes":32},{"value":14,"numvotes":58},{"value":16,"numvotes":41},{"value":18,"numvotes":11},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":6}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":173,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":11},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":145},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":17}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":240},"minplaytime":{"value":180},"maxplaytime":{"value":240},"minage":{"value":12},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1015,"value":"Civilization"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1026,"value":"Negotiation"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1001,"value":"Political"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1016,"value":"Science Fiction"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1113,"value":"Space Exploration"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1019,"value":"Wargame"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2001,"value":"Action Point Allowance System"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2021,"value":"Area-Impulse"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2072,"value":"Dice Rolling"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2026,"value":"Hex-and-Counter"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2011,"value":"Modular Board"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2008,"value":"Trading"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2079,"value":"Variable Phase Order"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2015,"value":"Variable Player Powers"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2017,"value":"Voting"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":12210,"value":"4X games"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":9983,"value":"Fantasy Flight Big Box"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":29,"value":"Twilight Imperium"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":95802,"value":"Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":22821,"value":"Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":24,"value":"Twilight Imperium","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":26055,"value":"Twilight Imperium (second edition)","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":21,"value":"Christian T.

They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&#10;&#10;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&#10;&#10;Viticulture - Essential Edition comes with components for Viticulture, but adds some of the expansions from Tuscany, including 36 Mama & Papa cards, Field cards (previously known as \"Properties\"), expanded/revised Visitors, and 24 Automa cards (solo variant), along with a couple of minor rule changes.&#10;&#10;Card Totals&#10;&#10;The Viticulture Essential Edition contains 164 cards at the 44 x 67 mm size and 88 cards at the 63 x 88 mm size.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":1},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":41,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":3}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":8},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":14},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":11},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":23},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":7},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":1},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":14},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":10}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":17}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":9,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":0},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":6},{"value":14,"numvotes":2},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":6,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":6},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":90},"minplaytime":{"value":90},"maxplaytime":{"value":90},"minage":{"value":13},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1021,"value":"Economic"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1013,"value":"Farming"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2040,"value":"Hand Management"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2082,"value":"Worker Placement"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5666,"value":"Solitaire Games"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":23988,"value":"Viticulture"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":8496,"value":"Wine Games"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":202174,"value":"Tuscany Essential Edition"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":193823,"value":"Viticulture: Moor Visitors Expansion"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":128621,"value":"Viticulture","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":71006,"value":"Morten Monrad Pedersen"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":62640,"value":"Jamey Stegmaier"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":62641,"value":"Alan Stone"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":65633,"value":"Jacqui Davis"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":44234,"value":"David Montgomery"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":71164,"value":"Beth Sobel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":22380,"value":"Feuerland Spiele"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":30677,"value":"Maldito Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":23202,"value":"Stonemaier Games"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":1634,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic355859_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic355859.jpg","name":{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Warhammer Quest"},"description":"Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice & 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":1995},"minplayers":{"value":1},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":31,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":8},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":15},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":23},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":6},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":4},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":10},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":3}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":16,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":2},{"value":10,"numvotes":4},{"value":12,"numvotes":5},{"value":14,"numvotes":4},{"value":16,"numvotes":1},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":15,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -

This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&#10;&#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2013},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":4},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":50,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":33}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":8},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":29},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":11}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":32},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":13},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":16},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":23},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":"4+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":3},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":25}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":15,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":0},{"value":8,"numvotes":9},{"value":10,"numvotes":6},{"value":12,"numvotes":0},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":18,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":1},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":16},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":1},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":30},"minplaytime":{"value":30},"maxplaytime":{"value":30},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1023,"value":"Bluffing"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1002,"value":"Card Game"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1010,"value":"Fantasy"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1046,"value":"Fighting"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2047,"value":"Memory"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2685,"value":"Player Elimination"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2661,"value":"Press Your Luck"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":28174,"value":"IELLO: Mini Games"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":211083,"value":"Welcome Back to the Dungeon: Easter Egg"},{"type":"boardgameexpansion","id":193533,"value":"Welcome to the Dungeon: Toad Promo"},{"type":"boardgameintegration","id":195043,"value":"Welcome Back to the Dungeon"},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":76303,"value":"Masato Uesugi"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":38196,"value":"Paul Mafayon"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":25074,"value":"BoardM Factory"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2366,"value":"Devir"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":28415,"value":"GoKids 玩樂小子"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":264,"value":"Heidelberger Spieleverlag"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":18852,"value":"Hobby World"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":24907,"value":"I Was Game"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8923,"value":"IELLO"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":6214,"value":"Kaissa Chess & Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":22649,"value":"Oink Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":2726,"value":"Portal Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":17786,"value":"uplay.it edizioni"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":1382,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3159401_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3159401.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Winner's Circle"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Royal Turf"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Круг чемпионов"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"馬場大贏家"}],"description":"A lively game of horse racing where players bet on several of seven horses to try to gain the most money by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A re-issue by Alea of Knizia's Turf Horse Racing published by Gibsons Games. This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&#10;&#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it's nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it's even crossed the start line. I've never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&#10;&#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game.  There's also a sprint bonus in the race and a penalty for the last horse.&#10;&#10;Republished by Face 2 Face Games as \"Winner's Circle\" in 2006.&#10;&#10;\"Royal Turf\" is #2 in the Alea small box series.&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2001},"minplayers":{"value":2},"maxplayers":{"value":6},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":61,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":30}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":13},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":33}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":2},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":33},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":12}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":14},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":38},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":0}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":31},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":33},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":18},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"6+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":2},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":19}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":20,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":2},{"value":6,"numvotes":6},{"value":8,"numvotes":10},{"value":10,"numvotes":1},{"value":12,"numvotes":1},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":0},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":24,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":24},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","numvotes":0},{"level":3,"value":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","numvotes":0},{"level":4,"value":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","numvotes":0},{"level":5,"value":"Unplayable in another language","numvotes":0}]}}],"playingtime":{"value":60},"minplaytime":{"value":45},"maxplaytime":{"value":60},"minage":{"value":10},"link":[{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1089,"value":"Animals"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1031,"value":"Racing"},{"type":"boardgamecategory","id":1038,"value":"Sports"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2014,"value":"Betting/Wagering"},{"type":"boardgamemechanic","id":2035,"value":"Roll / Spin and Move"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":60,"value":"Alea Small Box"},{"type":"boardgamefamily","id":5730,"value":"Sports: Horse Racing"},{"type":"boardgameimplementation","id":383,"value":"Turf Horse Racing","inbound":true},{"type":"boardgamedesigner","id":2,"value":"Reiner Knizia"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":13976,"value":"William O'Connor"},{"type":"boardgameartist","id":11883,"value":"Franz Vohwinkel"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":9,"value":"alea"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":23205,"value":"DiceTree Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":1705,"value":"Face2Face Games"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":34,"value":"Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"},{"type":"boardgamepublisher","id":8313,"value":"Smart Ltd"}]}}},{"items":{"termsofuse":"http://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse","item":{"type":"boardgame","id":20100,"thumbnail":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic521431_t.jpg","image":"//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic521431.jpg","name":[{"type":"primary","sortindex":1,"value":"Wits & Wagers"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Tiedolla tai Tuurilla"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Top & Flop"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Vett og Vedding"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Weten & Wedden: Party Edition"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Wits & Wagers: Deluxe Edition"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Wits and Wagers"},{"type":"alternate","sortindex":1,"value":"Держи пари"}],"description":"Not a trivia buff?

Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre).&#10;&#10;","yearpublished":{"value":2015},"minplayers":{"value":1},"maxplayers":{"value":12},"poll":[{"name":"suggested_numplayers","title":"User Suggested Number of Players","totalvotes":47,"results":[{"numplayers":1,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":4},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":24},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":2,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":9},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":23},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":5}]},{"numplayers":3,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":18},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":19},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":1}]},{"numplayers":4,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":9},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":25},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":4}]},{"numplayers":5,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":6},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":26},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":6}]},{"numplayers":6,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":26},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":12},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":7,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":3},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":9},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":14}]},{"numplayers":8,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":9,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":10,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":11,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":1},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":12,"result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]},{"numplayers":"12+","result":[{"value":"Best","numvotes":0},{"value":"Recommended","numvotes":0},{"value":"Not Recommended","numvotes":2}]}]},{"name":"suggested_playerage","title":"User Suggested Player Age","totalvotes":18,"results":{"result":[{"value":2,"numvotes":0},{"value":3,"numvotes":0},{"value":4,"numvotes":0},{"value":5,"numvotes":0},{"value":6,"numvotes":1},{"value":8,"numvotes":6},{"value":10,"numvotes":7},{"value":12,"numvotes":3},{"value":14,"numvotes":0},{"value":16,"numvotes":0},{"value":18,"numvotes":1},{"value":"21 and up","numvotes":0}]}},{"name":"language_dependence","title":"Language Dependence","totalvotes":15,"results":{"result":[{"level":1,"value":"No necessary in-game text","numvotes":0},{"level":2,"value":"Some necessary text -
